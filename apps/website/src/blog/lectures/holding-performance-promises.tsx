          Lecture Info: The ES2015 revision of JavaScript introduced Promises as
          primitives for asynchronous operations and generators as primitives
          for concurrent programming. On top of that ES2017/18 added async
          functions and generators. This talk briefly explores these primitives,
          and dives into the performance peculiarities of Promises-based
          programming paradigms. Weâ€™ll especially look into how these operations
          perform in V8, the JavaScript engine that powers both Node.js and
          Chrome.

          Short info: Normally simple tasks like running a program or storing
          and retrieving data become much more complicated when we start to do
          them on collections of computers, rather than single machines.
          Distributed systems has become a key architectural concern, and
          affects everything a program would normally doâ€”giving us enormous
          power, but at the cost of increased complexity as well.

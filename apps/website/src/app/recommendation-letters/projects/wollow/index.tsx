          I am writing this recommendation for Dimitar Danailov with great
          pleasure and respect. Dimitar has worked for me and with me for more
          than five years at https://wollow-soft.com. He has started as a
          programmer and passed all the levels to CTO in the last year. In terms
          of technical skills, he has an undeniable qualification, but for me
          and for the company he was highly esteemed for his loyalty and
          devotion. He is a person with whom I have worked with pleasure and I
          have had unreserved confidence in him, since we have managed more than
          100 projects in time and he has proven his competence and his ability
          to work on time and with quality. Rarely, we can meet people strongly
          devoted to their work, however Dimitar is one of them, and the
          priceless thing for him is that he transfers his energy and knowledge
          to the team, motivates them and he is one good example. Since the
          beginning he has demonstrated a strict compliance to the working
          processes and rules of the company. By taking the position of CTO in
          wollow-soft.com. Together with his help we have built the team from
          the base of three programmers to the current 28. Over the past years,
          we have participated in many risky projects and in his face I have
          always had a confidential and pragmatic partner in making quick and
          right decisions. In conclusion, let me say that without hesitation I
          recommend Dimitar Danailov for the position of lead programmer,
          related to software development. I am sure that he is going to be an
          invaluable asset for your organization. If you would like to discuss
          further my opinion and assessment of Dimitar, please do not hesitate
          to contact me.

          It is with great pleasure that I write this letter of recommendation
          on behalf of (https://wollow-soft.com), a knowledgeable, dynamic, and
          flexible technology partner. What impressed us most about Wollow’s
          approach to our project was their vision and leadership, commitment to
          the customer, insistence on setting realistic goals, with a succinct
          timelines, organization and project management, education and
          coaching. Bar none, their cutting edge technical expertise is of
          superior quality, delivered with a business-like approach. But it was
          the “everything else'' that completed the package. Wollow’s success is
          due to its winning team. The initial vision, leadership and project
          management of the CEO Ivelin Ivanov paved the way for our project’s
          success, and the technical expertise of the CTO Dimitar Danailov has
          provided a state-of-the-art platform for the projects we’ve worked
          together on. As a company, we are fully satisfied with the final
          product that Wollow has delivered. Based on our experience, we would
          recommend to anyone interested the services of Wollow since they are
          trusted and valuable long-term business partner.

          Even though my time with Dimitar was limited, I found him consistently
          pleasant, professional, and tackled all programming assignments with
          dedication and a view of total success. Besides being a joy to work
          with, Dimitar is a take - charge person who is able to present
          creative ideas and communicate the benefits. I highly recommend
          Dimitar for employment. He is a team player and would make a great
          asset to any organization.

          Dimitar is an outstanding mentor. His guidance helped me progress with
          Ruby on Rails with ease and discover more about developing web-based
          software. Even after my internship at wollow-soft ended, he continued
          assisting me with advice. Definitely a great person to learn from and
          to work with!

          Dimitar is an excellent programmer and soul of the team. I am glad
          that I be given the opportunity to recommend it because I have a very
          positive impression of his personality. We spent over a year and a
          half working together in 158ltd.com. and in that time he managed to
          pass me a lot of knowledge in the IT field. Whenever I needed help or
          advice he has responded and helped me. I'm sure Dimitar would be a
          great part of every team.
